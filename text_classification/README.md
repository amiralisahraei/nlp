# Text Classification
Here I am sharing a NLP project regarding text classification on IMDB dataset. Actually, there are two versions:
- Without Embedding layer (apply Glove for embedding)
- With Embedding layer

In addiotion, I've developed this project in both Keras and Pytorch versions. But the Pytorch version has no Embedding layer (only Glove is used).



## Run The Project

Install the necessary libraries

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Thanks to [Mohammad Taghizadeh](https://github.com/M-Taghizadeh) regarding Keras version
